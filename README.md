# Algorithms and Data Structures Revision/Practice (WIP)

All code is written in Python 3. Some scripts use the type hints in Python 3.5+ and f-strings in 3.6+, but should be easily modifiable to run on older versions.

Imports are currently a mess due to Python's weird handling of relative imports - where one file here is importing another file, it's intended to
work when run as a script (e.g. `python sorting/merge_sort.py`), and will probably fail otherwise.
